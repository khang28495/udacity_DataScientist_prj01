1. Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

2. Project Motivation
Airbnb, which stands for Air Bed and Breakfast, is a community marketplace for booking and renting rooms and apartments, based in Silicon Valley, California founded in 2008, similar to an online ordering system. According to Wikipedia, more than 10 million overnight stays were booked through Airbnb from 2008 to 2012. There are over 14 million listings for rentals in more than 190 countries (as of August 2017).

In this project, we are going to answer three business questions:

Question 1: What amenities do Boston rooms have?
Question 2: When is a good time to book a room in Boston?
Question 3: What relates to the price of rooms in Boston?

This project follows CRISP-DM data science process, which has 6 major phases:

Business understanding
Data understanding
Data preparing
Data Modeling
Result Evaluation
Deployment (excluded in this project)
3. File Descriptions
There is only one notebook to showcase work as CRISP-DM process to answer the three above questions. Markdown cells are used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

A folder named dataset contains two dataset files in CSV format.

4. Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
